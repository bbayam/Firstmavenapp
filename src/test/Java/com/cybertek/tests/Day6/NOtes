Hello!

Today is 7/2/2019

We will talk about check boxes, radio buttons, and something else:)

Please work on the warm up task!

TEST 1
go to amazon
enter any search term
click on search button
verify title contains search term

TEST 2
go to wikipedia.org
enter search term ‘selenium webdriver’
click on search button
click on search result ‘Selenium (software)’
verify url ends with ‘x’

Advise: Do not try to make test pass. You have to find bugs.

Goal of tester(manual or automation) to catch bugs. If your script fails - maybe you found a bug. Do not try to make your test pass.


Story:

I found a bug, in the application, with my co-worker script. The thing was, his script wasn't working properly. Why? because he had to fill out work with different values. But what he he entered into form, same values. I noticed from the regression report, that test data looks weird. I've tried to change his test and run it again. Turns out that out of two input boxes, only one was saving data, another one - was just copying data.

What do you do if script fails?

Run it again, maybe it's a script issue (locators are wrong, not enough wait time, etc..)

Test manually (if your script is correct, confirm bug by manual testing)
If it's a bug - report.

This an example of radio button.

<input type="radio" id="blue" name="color" checked="">

Tag name - input

type - radio

These 2 things are required if you want to create radio button.

.isSelected() - verifies if radio button/check box is selected. Returns true or false.

isEnabled() - Is the element currently enabled or not?

Or in other words, isEnabled() returns true if you can click on radio button. If it's disabled - it will return false.

!greenBTN.isEnabled() - to check if button is disabled.


	//TASK!
    //write a test(method) that will do following:
    //verify that blue button is selected
    //then click on black button
    //verify that black button is selected
    //verify that blue button is not selected

Relative xpath that can find all radio buttons on the page:
//input[@type='radio']

Most common syntax of xpath: //tagname[@attribute='value']
Every radio button must have tag input, and be type of radio
